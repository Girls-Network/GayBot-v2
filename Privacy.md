# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 23 February 2026
**Last Updated:** 23 February 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how GayBot ("the Bot"), operated by Girls Network Technologies Ltd ("we", "us", or "our"), collects, uses, and handles information when you use the Bot in your Discord server.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information Collected Automatically

When you interact with GayBot, the following data may be processed:

- **User IDs** – Your Discord user ID, used to process commands and apply any configured overrides (e.g. `/gaycounter`).
- **Server (Guild) IDs** – Used to deploy and manage slash commands within your server.
- **Message Content** – Message text is read in real time solely to detect keywords for automated emoji reactions. Message content is **not stored** beyond the instant it is processed.
- **Command Interactions** – Slash command inputs (e.g. search terms submitted via `/lgbtqsearch`) are processed to fulfil your request and are **not persistently stored**.

### 1.2 Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, or retain:

- The content of your messages beyond transient, in-memory processing.
- Personal information such as your name, email address, or IP address.
- Payment or financial information of any kind.
- Data from users who do not interact with the Bot.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

The information processed by GayBot is used solely to:

- Execute commands you initiate (e.g. `/ping`, `/gaycounter`, `/lgbtqsearch`, `/help`).
- React to messages containing configured keywords with appropriate emoji.
- Deploy and register slash commands to Discord guilds.
- Write error logs for debugging purposes. Error logs may contain command names and interaction IDs but do **not** contain message content or personal data.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

GayBot does **not** operate a database. No user data is persistently stored by the Bot itself.

**Error logs** are written locally to the host environment and contain only timestamps, error messages, and command context. These logs are retained temporarily for operational purposes and are not shared externally.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

GayBot may interact with the following third-party services:

- **Discord API** – All Bot functionality is delivered via the Discord API. Discord's own [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) governs how Discord handles your data.
- **girlsnetwork.dev API** – The `/lgbtqsearch` command queries the Girls Network public API to retrieve definitions. The search term you submit is sent to this API. No personally identifiable information is transmitted.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties, except as required by law or as described in Section 4 above.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

GayBot is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has interacted with the Bot in a way that has resulted in data collection, please contact us.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, or request deletion of data we hold about you. As we do not persistently store personal data, there is typically no data for us to provide or delete.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of GayBot following any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this document will reflect any changes.
